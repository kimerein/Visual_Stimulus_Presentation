FIG2XLS is Windows only. It has been tested recently with:

	MATLAB 5.3.1
	MATLAB 6.1
	MATLAB 6.5 (with COM patch)
	Excel 2000
	Win2000

However, it is expected to work with some earlier versions of MATLAB, Excel
and Windows.

In order to use FIG2XLS with MATLAB 6.5 you must must fix certain COM issues 
(otherwise known as bugs). The instructions that follow are taken from TMW's 
response to a segmentation violation report.

COM patch for 6.5:
------------------

There are several issues in the COM interface that was shipped with MATLAB 
6.5 (R13).  Please see the following problem descriptions.  If you are 
running into a similar issue, you should replace the specified updated
files.

Fixes for all the problems listed below have been addressed in updated 
versions of comcli.dll and newprogid.m.  These updated versions should 
replace the current versions in your MATLAB installation.  Both are 
available for download from our FTP site at the following location:

ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/tech-support/solutions/s33520/

The file newprogid.m, should be downloaded to the following directory:

$MATLAB\toolbox\matlab\winfun\comcli\private

and comcli.dll should be downloaded to

$MATLAB\bin\win32

(where $MATLAB is the root directory where MATLAB installed)

After downloading the files, you must restart MATLAB.
