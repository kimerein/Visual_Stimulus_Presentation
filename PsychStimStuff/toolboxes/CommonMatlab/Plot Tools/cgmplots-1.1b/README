CGUNAY's MATLAB PLOTTING TOOLBOX (CGMPLOT)
==========================================

CGMPLOT improves Matlab plotting by:
- Adds intelligent controls to produce publication-quality figures 
from Matlab
- Wrapping existing plot commands into objects that can be modularly 
stacked and superposed
- In stacked multiplots:
	- Modular horizontal and vertical stack plots can be nested
	- Minimizes lost space by intelligent options to put axis labels only once
- In superposed plots:
	- Legends automatically appear matching plotted info
	- Inset plots can be produced.
- Specialized bar, errorbar and image plots are defined.


Installation:
--------------------

Copy the cgmplots/ directory under the toolbox subdirectory in your
Matlab installation.  Alternatively, you can use the Matlab "addpath"
command to add the cgmplots// subdirectory to the Matlab search path.

Documentation:
