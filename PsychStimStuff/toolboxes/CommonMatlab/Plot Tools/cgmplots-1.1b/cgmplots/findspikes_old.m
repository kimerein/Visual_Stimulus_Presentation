% [timeidx, peakval, n] = findspikes(trace, threshold, plotit)
% 
% Find and return: spike times (timeidx), spike peak amplitude (peakval) 
% and number of spikes (n) in the given trace above the given threshold.
% If plotit is 1, a figure is displayed for visual inspection.
% 
% NOTE: Only positive (up stroke) spike peaks are treated and are found
%       on the basis of a "three-point first derivative evaluation".
